    <blockquote>
      "The <span class = "redacted">programmer, like the poet, works
        only slightly removed from pure</span>
        thought-stuff <span class = "redacted">. He</span>
        builds <span class = "redacted">his castles in the air, from
        air, creating</span> by exertion <span class = "redacted">of
        the imagination</span>."<b>&mdash; <a href =

    <blockquote>
      "A human must turn information into intelligence or
      knowledge. <em>We've tended to forget that no computer will ever

    <blockquote>
      "The <a href = "https://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html">Analytical
      Engine</a> has no pretensions whatever to <i>originate</i>
      anything. It can do whatever we <i>know how to order it</i> to
      perform. It can <i>follow</i> analysis; but it has no power of
      <i>anticipating</i> any analytical relations or truths. Its province is
      to assist us to making <i>available</i> what we are already acquainted
      with." <b>&mdash;

    <blockquote>
      "Because the process of knowing is inseparable from
      <strike>"languaging,"</strike> "coding," in the new education,
      <strike>language</strike> code (i.e., all forms of symbolic
      codification) is regarded as the mediator of all human
      perception and is used as a unifying and continuing focus of all
      student inquiry."  &mdash;
